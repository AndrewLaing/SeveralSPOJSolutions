3442 LASTDIG - The last digit

Nestor was doing the work of his math class about three days but he is tired of make operations 
a lot and he should deliver his task tomorrow. 
His mathâ€™s teacher gives him two numbers a and b. 
The problem consist of finding the last digit of the potency of base a and index b. 
Help Nestor with his problem. 

You are given two integer numbers: 
	the base a (0 <= a <= 20) 
	and the index b (0 <= b <= 2,147,483,000), 

a and b both are not 0. You have to find the last digit of ab.

Input

The first line of input contains an integer t, the number of test cases (t <= 30). 
t test cases follow. For each test case will appear a and b separated by space.

Output

For each test case output an integer per line representing the result.

Example

Input:
2
3 10
6 2

Output:
9
6

Patterns repeat every 4 so sequence restarts every 20
to get the position get the last two numbers and mod by 20

eg	 1000092					   base 7
	 1000092 >> 2
	   10000
	 10000 << 2
	 1000000
	 1000092 - 1000000
		  92
	 92 % 20
		  12
		  
result = 1

how to get 1 2 3 or 4? (easier for powers)
